# Stream-Enhancer-Site

The static site + Electron app for viewing streams from Stream-Enhancer

The Auth-Getter directory was the server used in research for [this](https://blog.jonlu.ca/posts/illegal-streams) article.

Static contains the initial static site work, which fails on unsafe headers.

Electron contains the electron app.

## Usage

In the electron app, run `npm install` then `npm start`. To build a DMG run `npm run dist`.
